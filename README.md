# TwinStick
This is an (untitled) Twin-Stick arena shooter prototype that we at Special Duck Studio have decided not to develop into a full game. However, we believe that the source files could be instructive and may eventually use this as the basis for a tutorial series. In the mean time, we are releasing the project files under the MIT license so that anyone interested can have a look under the hood.

*Please note: This game requires a controller to play.*
